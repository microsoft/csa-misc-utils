### Training 2

#### Cloud AI Bootcamp 
<a name="learnaibootcamp"></a>
The goal of this four day bootcamp is to provide a kick-start to individuals who need to develop deeper proficiency with the range of the Microsoft Cloud AI platform. These days are not "Getting Started with..." the various services and assume a 100-200-level familiarity with the products prior to getting started.

The structure of all 4-days is intended to be hands-on. Each lab should be able to be run in relative isolation, so as long as **appropriate pre-requisites are met**, an individual should be able to complete a given lab without needing to complete the others.
