### Microsoft Academy


#### Overview

Link to Microsoft Academy: https://academy.microsoft.com

Microsoft provides training tracks in partnership with edX.org. edX.org are online self-paced courses on various topics.  For an easy to follow process, Microsoft has created tracks on https://academy.microsoft.com/
 
The eight (8) course tracks are:
 * [Cloud Administration](https://academy.microsoft.com/en-us/professional-program/tracks/cloud-administration/)
 * [Data Science](https://academy.microsoft.com/en-us/professional-program/tracks/data-science/) 
 * [Artificial Intelligence](https://academy.microsoft.com/en-us/professional-program/tracks/artificial-intelligence/)
 * [Big Data](https://academy.microsoft.com/en-us/professional-program/tracks/big-data/) 
 * [DevOps](https://academy.microsoft.com/en-us/professional-program/tracks/devops/)
 * [Front-End Web Development](https://academy.microsoft.com/en-us/professional-program/tracks/front-end-development/)
 * [Entry Level Software Development](https://academy.microsoft.com/en-us/professional-program/tracks/entry-level-software-development/)
 * [IT Support](https://academy.microsoft.com/en-us/professional-program/tracks/it-support/)
 
If you are looking for a place to start I would recommend Cloud Administration or DevOps if you have an Infrastructure or AppDev background, and Data Science or Big Data if you have a data background.
 
Most of these courses are developed by Microsoft. If Microsoft did not create the course but it is part of the track, then we have approved it.
 
Other Azure and Microsoft courses are available on edx.org. You will need a Microsoft account and an edX.org account to take these courses. In the next section we will walk through signing up for these accounts as well as getting started with your first course.
 
There are Microsoft Professional Program (MPP) Certificates tied to each track for a low cost.  All classes can be audited for free if the Certificate is not needed.

With the Facebook, Google, or Microsoft accounts you will need to accept permissions for those accounts to access edX.org. The Microsoft accounts are work or school accounts not the outlook.com consumer account we created in the last section.
 
You will also need to create an edX.org username. This should not be your full email address. This username will be public on edX.org forums, certificates and linked accounts.
