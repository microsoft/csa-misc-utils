#### Microsoft IoT School


IoT School is another set of courses for jump-starting IoT education on the Microsoft platform. Courses here are not split into tracks like academy.microsoft.com. The courses are tagged as beginner, intermediate, and advanced. 
 
Courses can be filters by
 * Level - beginner, intermediate, and advanced
 * Service - Azure Services included in the course
 * Tools – VS Code, Azure IoT SDK, Windows, Linux
 * Languages – programming languages used in the course
 
Courses times range from 11 minutes to over 2 hours for a few of the courses. 
 
Courses can be made up of multiple modules. Progress on a course or all the courses can be tracked by logging in with your personal Microsoft account. If you need help signing up for a personal Microsoft account refer to the [Signing up for a Microsoft Account](#signup)  in the [Microsoft Academy](#academy) section.
 
Courses are free of charge but the resources for the course are the responsibility of the person taking the course.
