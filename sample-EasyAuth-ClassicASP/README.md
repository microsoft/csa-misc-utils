## Easy Auth for Classic ASP

This is a hacked-up PoC showing how Classic ASP can take advantage of the Easy Auth feature of Azure App Services. 
Easy Auth makes the id_token from Azure AD available in a header after authentication; this parses the token
(App Services will have already validated it and logged you in), and sets the claims in session state. 

If you are interested in deploying this in a Windows Container in App Service, a dockerfile is also
available in the solution directory.
